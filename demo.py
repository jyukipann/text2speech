This paper proposes a domain adaptation method for accurate object detection from in-vehicle FIR camera images. Many accurate detection models are proposed in the visible-light domain. It is, however, heavily affected by weather and lighting conditions. In contrast, FIR images are less affected by them. The proposed method projects visible-light-domain detection results onto far-infrared images, and uses them as pseudo labels for training an FIR-domain detection model. Experiments show that the proposed method improves the detection accuracy and is comparable to a reference method using manually-labeled data. The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of visible-light-to-far-infrared domain adaptation for robust FIR-domain object detection. Please come to our poster and letâ€™s discuss in more details.
